SWAPI GraphQL Wrapper
=====================

A wrapper around [SWAPI](http://swapi.co) built using GraphQL.

Uses:

* [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - a JavaScript GraphQL runtime.
* [DataLoader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) - for coalescing and caching fetches.
* [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) - to provide HTTP access to GraphQL.
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - for easy exploration of this GraphQL server.
